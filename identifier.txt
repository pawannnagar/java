1. iidentifier dshould be from combination of following character 
a to z
A to Z
0 to 9
$
-
2.identifier should not be start from digit
compiler confusion
int ap=10;
int 9p=4; false
3.there is no length limit for java identifier but as for the real time idustry we need to make identifier 
length as possible as minimum

4.we can not use reserved word as an identifier in java
int if=10; false
int for=20; false

5.java is case sensitive language that means in java uppercase and lower case chracter will be
treated differently 
int if=10; false
int IF=20; true

6.in java we can use predefined class and interface name as an identifier but in real time 
industry it is not recommonded TO take predefined class and interface name as an identier becuase 
it will create confusion and will decrease the readability
