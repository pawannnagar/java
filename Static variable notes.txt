Static variable-1.if value of the variable is not changing from object  to object
and it is same for all the object then it is recommonded to define that variable 
as a static
2.in case of static variable only a single copy will be created at class level
and all the object will share that copy only
3.a static variable will be created at the time of class loading and it will be 
destroy at the time of class unloading 
4.static variable store inside method area
5.we need to define static variable directly inside class with static modifier
6.we can access static varible by using following 3 ways
a.direct
b.by using object reference variable 
b.by using class name
**if we want to access static variable directtly then can only do this from same class
at real time industry standard it is always recommonded to access static variable by using 
class name as due to  this readability will be improved
