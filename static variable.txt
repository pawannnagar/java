Static variable-->1.it value of a variable is not changing from object to objECT and it is same for
all the object then it is recommonded to define that variable as static variable
2.in the case of static variable only a single copy will be created at class level and all the object
will share that copy only.
3.a static variable will be created at the time of class loading and it will be destroy of class unloading 
4.static variable store inside method area.
5.we need to define static variable directly inside class with the help of static modifier.
6.we can access static variable by using following 3 ways
direct
by using object reference variable 
by using class name
if we wnt to access static variable directly then can only do this from the same class.
at real time industry standard it is recommonded to access static variable by using class name 
as due to this readability will b improved .
