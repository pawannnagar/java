VARIABLE --variable is devided into two catagories
1.Division-1
2.Division-2
based on the value represented by varible Division-1 is devided into two catagories 
a.primitive variable 
b.reference variable 
based on the position of declaration and behavior Division-2 is devided into three catagory 
a.instance varible 
b.static varible 
c.local variable 

there are total 8 primitive data type 
byte short int long foat double char boolean 

a.instance variable -1.if the value of a varible is changing from object to object
then it is recommonded to define that variable as instance variable .

2.for every object is seperate copy of instance variable will be created 

3.instance varwiable will be created at a time of object creation and it will be destroy 
at the time of object destruction that means life of instance variable is exactly same as life of 
object

4.instance variable will be stored in heap area as a part of object 

5.we need to declare instance variable directly in the class 

6.we can access instance varible only by using object reference variable
